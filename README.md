### **Paper 2**
- **Title:** Real-Time Digital Assistance for Exercise: Exercise Tracking System with MediaPipe Angle Directive Rule  
- **Authors:** Kok Swee Sim, Shun Wei Wong, Alex Low, Andi  
- **Year:** 2024  
- **Technologies:** MediaPipe, YOLOv7, Angle Directive Rules  
- **Domain:** Body Tracking  
- **Summary:** Focuses on developing an exercise tracking system capable of recognizing simple exercises (push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups) with high accuracy using pose estimation techniques.  
- **Results:** The expand-shrink MLP model achieved **16% higher accuracy** than the baseline model.  
- **Limitations:** Issues related to data privacy, cost, user experience, interoperability, and regulatory challenges.  
- **Comments:** The study aims to develop an improved Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for exercise recognition.

### **Paper 3**
- **Title:** Body Posture Detection Using Computer Vision  
- **Authors:** Anand Upadhyay, Ketan Chaudhari, Pradip Bhere, Jerin Thomas  
- **Year:** 2020  
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, Pyroelectric Infrared Sensors  
- **Domain:** Body Posture Detection  
- **Summary:** Focuses on analyzing and understanding human posture and movements from digital images and videos without using external sensors.  
- **Results:** The OpenCV-based method is more affordable and practical than sensor-based systems.  
- **Limitations:** Lower accuracy compared to accelerometer/gyroscope-based systems; difficulty detecting poses when obstacles block the camera’s view.  
- **Comments:** Human body posture recognition has become a key area of computer vision research with significant progress over recent years.

### **Paper 4**
- **Title:** 3D Tracking of Human Motion Using Visual Skeletonization and Stereoscopic Vision  
- **Authors:** Matteo Zago, Matteo Luzzago, Tommaso Marangoni, Mariolino de Cecco, Marco Tarabini, Manuela Galli  
- **Year:** 2020  
- **Technologies:** OpenPose, low-cost webcams  
- **Domain:** 3D Body Tracking  
- **Summary:** Proposes a stereoscopic vision method for 3D reconstruction of the human skeleton from synchronized video feeds.  
- **Results:** The lowest step length error (**1.53 cm**) was achieved with the 1.8 m high-resolution, straight gait setup.  
- **Limitations:** Pilot study with only two participants; future work should include larger populations and more complex multi-camera setups.  
- **Comments:** Provides a metrological analysis of OpenPose performance in gait analysis using low-cost stereoscopic vision.

- **Authors:** Amir Nadeem, Ahmad Jalal, Kibum Kim  
- **Year:** 2020  
- **Technologies:** Camera, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  
- **Domain:** Human Action Recognition  
- **Summary:** Proposes detecting human actions by segmenting body parts (head, shoulders, hands, torso, hips, feet, knees) and classifying movement using neural networks.  
- **Results:** Achieved **89.41%** body parts detection accuracy on the Weizmann dataset.  
- **Limitations:** Confusion between similar actions such as passing, shooting, and running.  
- **Comments:** Introduces a new body part–based segmentation approach for action recognition using multidimensional feature analysis.
